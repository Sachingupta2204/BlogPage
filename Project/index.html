                    <p>Before the assembly elections in Gujarat, Congress has come into action mode. At present, the Congress does not have a full-time state president. Congress appointed 7 working presidents including Jignesh Mevani in Gujarat</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Earlier, Congress had given Hardik Patel the post of working state president in Gujarat, 
                        but Hardik was not happy with it. He said that he does not have  the freedom and right to take decisions. 
                        Angered by this, Hardik resigned from the Congress on 18 May 2022. At that time, while targeting Rahul Gandhi, Hardik had said that whether there should be a temple of Lord Ram in Ayodhya, whether it is the issue of citizenship law-NRC
                    </p>
                    <p>Following these allegations, Hardik Patel joined the BJP on June 2. However, Congress leader Jagdish Thokar said that Hardik left the party because he feared that he might have to go to jail for sedition. At the same time, Shweta Brahmbhatt, who was the face of Gujarat Youth Congress after Hardik, also left Congress and joined BJP</p>

The Indian team recently lost the Edgbaston Test match, during the same match when England's Alex Lees was out, Virat Kohli's celebration was worth watching. Virat was so lost in the celebration that he reached the danger area on the pitch</p>
                <p>Now an England journalist objected to this celebration of Virat Kohli and wrote that this is a funny place to celebrate the wicket of Alex Lees. When  this tweet came in the discussion, West Indies cricketer Tino Best replied to this tweet. </p>
